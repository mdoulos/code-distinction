# code-distinction

A basic color theme for VS Code that creates different colors for PHP, Javascript, and HTML- languages I work with.

Code Distinction. Notice the pink and purple colors chosen for PHP, Blue for HTML, and Orange for Javascript.

Before Code Distinction. Example of a normal color theme: Visual Studio Dark. Notice how there is no visual difference between the languages. Also notice how the bright green chosen for comments is intrusive compared to a grey.

Note: I configured action hooks to be made grey regardless of the theme. That's not a part of either color theme.
